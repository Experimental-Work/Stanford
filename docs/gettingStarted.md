# Getting Started with LLM Agents

This document provides an overview of the LLM agents available in the `llm_agents/` directory and instructions on how to use them.

## 1. Langchain Comprehension (langchain_comprehension.py)

This script demonstrates the use of LangChain for processing and summarizing PDF documents.

### How it works:
- Fetches PDF documents from both URLs and local files.
- Uses two summarization methods: 'stuff' and 'map-reduce'.
- Compares the summaries generated by both methods.

### How to use:
1. Ensure you have the required dependencies installed.
2. Set up your OpenAI API key in the `.env` file in the parent directory.
3. Run the script:
   ```
   python -m llm_agents.langchain_comprehension
   ```
4. The script will process the predefined list of PDF URLs and local files, generating summaries and comparisons for each.

## 2. Company Lookup (company_lookup.py)

This script allows users to retrieve specific information about a company using OpenAI's GPT-4 model.

### How it works:
- Prompts the user for a company name and URL.
- Offers four types of information to retrieve about the company.
- Uses OpenAI's API to generate a response based on the user's query.

### How to use:
1. Ensure you have the OpenAI Python package installed and your API key set up in the `.env` file.
2. Run the script:
   ```
   python -m llm_agents.company_lookup
   ```
3. Follow the prompts to enter a company name, URL, and choose the type of information you want to retrieve.
4. The script will display the generated response from GPT-4.

## Additional Notes

- Make sure to install all required dependencies before running the scripts.
- Keep your OpenAI API key secure and never share it publicly.
- The `scripts/upgrade_langchain.sh` script is available to help upgrade LangChain imports if needed.
